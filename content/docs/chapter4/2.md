# Usability



Usabilty is a multidimensional nonfunctional requirement in software engineering and UI design. Some
systems are hard to understand and
therefore also hard to use. This gets even worse when
usability is not considered carefully
enough.

Usability usually asks the following similar questions before adapting a particular feature into the UI:

*  What is the level
of expertise for the user or did your
user use the computer before?
*  What user
interface standards are familiar to the
user? 
* Does the user know about buttons,
dropdowns, menus etc? 
* What documentation
should be provided to the user? 
* So does
the user actually the manual or
documentation or is a software self
explanatory. 

## Dimensions of Usable UI

Usability is 
multi-dimensional and it can be derived
into five different categories:
* **Learnability** describes for example how
hard is as a beginner to use the
software for the first time or actually
learn how to use it.
* **Efficiency** describes if an advanced user
is able to use the system efficiently.
For example after using the software for
a while, does the user feel it's fast
and easy to use. Or can the user follow his
or her industrial processes or duties
without being interrupted or slowed down
by the system? 
* **Memorability** describes how
easy it is for a user who actually
learned already to system and having
been used for a while to get back onto
it. And then there's error handling this
describes if the application presents
the user with the chance of error
recovery for example if no printer is
connected
is there a fallback to the PDF export or
a cancel button or does the application
just crash when you click on the print
button? 
* **Satisfaction** are also known as user
experience describes if the application
presents information in an appealing way
or in other words is actually fun to use?
Let's have a look at our explanation
video describing what a system model use
a model and a user interface model is
and how do they correspond to each other:
As a software engineer in the university
app project you have an idea of how the
system would work.
