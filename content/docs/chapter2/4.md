# Scrum

There are two types of process controls in software engineering. These are defined process controls and empirical process control. 

Defined process control are models loke waterfall or the v-model where processes are planned, follow strict rules and avoid deviations. They do not deal with change very well.

Empirical process controls are not entirely planned and allow the teams to inspect and adapt. The spiral model is an example of this. 

Scrum is a popular empirical process control model used mainly by small development teams. 

## Focus of Scrum Process
Scrum is the most popular agile method. It start out with the specification of **product backlogs** which determine the rough requirements of a software problem. Then they carry on with sprint backlogs for the next 2-4 weeks.

It is a management and control process that focuses on Early risk management. Each review, look at software that looks on goals for the next 2-4 weeks and delivers working software incrementally, adapting the process when it is required

## Parts of Scrum 
* Product Kickoff Meeting
    * Owner
    * List of rough requirements
    * Rough Requirements → Product Backlog
* Sprint Planning Meeting
    * Items from the product backlog → Sprint Backlog
* Sprint Review Meeting
    * Developments presented to the owner
    * Retrospective on how the team collaborated together

A **sprint** is a time boxed activity during which the team creates a potentially shippable product increment.
* Consistant duration
* Start: Sprint planning meeting
* End: Sprint review meeting


## Scrum Team 
* Development Team
    * Self-organizing - Pulls the tasks and decide what they are working on
    * Cross functional - Different experts (tester, analyst, manager etc)
    * Product Increment - Realize the sprint backlog items and turn it into a product increment
* Scrum Master 
    * Resolved impediments
    * Responsible for process
* Product Owner
    * Defines the products
    * Like a requirements engineer
    * Responsible for the results


## Scrum Meetings
* Project kickoff meeting:
create and prioritize product b
acklog
* Sprint planning meeting: Create sprint backlog
* Daily scrum meeting: 15 min standup meeting to share status, impediments and promises
* Sprint review meeting: Demonstration of realized backlog items to the product owner
* Sprint retrospective: inspect the sprint and find improvements for the next sprint

## Scrum Artifacts

* Product backlog: list of requirements for the whole product
* Sprint backlog: list of requirements and tasks for one iteration (sprint)
* Potentially shippable product increment:release to the product owner
