# Software Lifecycle Models

There are different questions in sofware development that lead to good software solutions. These questions are addressed by software development activites:

There are different questions in software development 
* **Requirements Elicitation**: What is the problem?
* **Requirements Analysis**: Partition the problem into smaller pieces
* **System Design**: Design solutions for
* **Object Design**: What are the best mechanisms to implement the solution? 
* **Implementation**: How is the solution constructed?
* **Testing**: Is the problem solved? 
* **Delivery**: Can the customer use the solution?
* **Maintenance**: Are enhancements needed?

## Software Lifecycle

A software lifecycle is a set of activites and their realtionships to each other for the development of a software system. 

A software lifecycle model is an abstraction that represents a software lifecycle for the purpose of understanding, monitoring and controlling the development of a software system.

There are many types of software lifecycles. Some of these are called dinasour models because they are archaic and should be avoided if possible. 

Below are three examples of models we should avoid:

## Waterfall Model

* The activites in the waterfall model must be completed in sequential model them moved on to the mext activity
* If there is a change or a faliure, we should start on the beginning

## V Model

This is an adaptation on the waterfall model that focuses on testing more however if there is a change in the requirememts we should start from the beginning.

## Spiral Model

This is one of the first iterative models which focus on risk analysis. The earlier phases focus on risk analysis, then design then software design. 

This is an improvement over the sequential models but it is still something that should be avoided.
