# Communication

Communication is very important in software engineering and various guidelines need to be followed to maintain effective communication within internal and external stakeholders.

## Communication Skills in SE
* Collaboration: Negotiating requirements
* Presentation: Presenting the system during a review
* Technical Writing: Writing proposals and project documentation
* Maanagement: Facilitate team meetings, find compromises, negotiate conflicts etc.


 People need to communicate more in larger companies as there are more stakeholders and more project working on the same project

 A clear and accurate communication stream is critical for successful software development.

 ## Types of Effective Communication

 * Communication Event: Information exchange with defined objectives and scope
    * Scheduled Event: Meetings, planned, regular
    * Unscheduled Event: Informaal, hallway meetings, coffee breaks etc.


* Communication Mechanisms: Tool or procedure that can be used to deal with a communication event:
    * Synchronus Mechanism: Tools where both partners required to be available at the same time (in person, Skype etc.)
    * Asynchronus Mechanisms: Tools where both partners are not required to be available at the same time (IM, Slack, Github Issues)

## Meeting Management

Meetings often have undesired outcomes therefore it is important to have a meeting moderation. 

Common meeting problems are:
* people get bored
* forget to discuss important details
* no one writes the meeting points down so it is forgotten
* participants are not allowed the opportunity to speak

A typical meeting should have three different moderators who have the job of making the meeting more effective. These roles can be switched around to ensure equality and based on who is responsible for the project.

* A **facilitator** keeps the discussion on topic and often presents the most important ideas
* A **minute taker** tracks time and makes sure everybody gets an opportunity to speak
* A **time keeper** takes notes behind the scenes and sends them to the rest of the team

## Meeting Guidelines
* Active Listening
* No one on one or side meetings
* Respect the agenda and keep time
* Willingness to reach consensus
