# Debugging

Debugging is a technique of finding and resolving  of defects that prevent correct operations of software systems

In the early days of computing, debugging was cumbersome but now debugging is more seamless because of various tools called debuggers. 

We can use debuggers in various languages and various IDEs. 

Here are some of the debugging techniques for the most common IDEs in some common OOP languages. 

## Debugging Process: Steps involved in debugging are:
* Identifying the problem
* Assigning the report to software engineer to the defect to verify that it is genuine.
* Defect Analysis using modeling, documentations, finding and testing candidate flaws, etc.
* Defect Resolution by making required changes to the system.
* Validation of corrections.

## Common Debugging Tools

### Python

### Java

## Concepts in Debugging

* Compiler: A computer program that transforms a source code into object code to create a machine executable program. A compiler error is the most common error when usually there is some missing syntax that does not allow the program to be executed. 
* Breakpoint: A breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing point in the program temporarily added to inspect the underlying mechanics and check for errors.
    * Exceptional Breakpoints
    * Conditional Breakpoints
