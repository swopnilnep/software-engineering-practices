# Distributed Version Control

In a distributed version control system, there
is a remote repository. While there can
be multiple remote repositories, in most
cases there's only one. Developers have a
local repository on the computer and
interact with this local repository in
order to obtain changes from the remote
repository and in order to upload their
changes to the remote repository. Other
developers connect also over their local
repository to the remote repository, so
that they can exchange files and changes
on these files. 

 In
addition, most of the distributed
version control repositories such as
GitHub or Bitbucket
offer a web interface where developers
can also access the files in the browser
and even change some of the files in the
browser.
