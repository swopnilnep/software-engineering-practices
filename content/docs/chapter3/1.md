# Software Configuration Management

 Why Software Configuration Management is required
* Promotion, Release, Revision
Software Configuration Management allows you to
* Track versions & collaborate
* Change Management
* Build and Release Management
Multiple people work on artifacts that are changing:
* More than one version of the artifact supported
    * Source Code
    * Documents
    * Released software system
* Software is running on different machines, operating systems in the target environment
* Need for coordination (software configuration management)
 
Definition: Encompasses disciplines and techniques for
* Initiating, evaluating and controlling change to work products
* During and after a software project
Project function with the goal to make technical and managerial activities more effective.
IEEE 828-2012 - Standard that defines software configuration management
Terminology
* Version:  Specific instance of configuration items
* Release: Formal distribution of an approved version (to external stakeholders)
* Revision: Minor change to the version / does not effect additional functionality
* Baseline: Work product that has been (formally) reviewed and that thereafter can be changed only through change and control procedures
6 Activities
* Configuration item identification - modeling the system as a set of evolving components
* Promotion Management - Creation of versions for other developers
* Build and Release Management - Creation of versions for clients and users
* Change Managenents - Handling, approach and tracking of change requests
* Branch Management
* Variant Management - Multiple versions of the product based on the same baseline
