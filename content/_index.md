# Introduction

*Note: This website will be in continuous development in the month of January 2019. There may be some incomplete or missing content in some parts of the project.*

## Author

Hi! I am Swopnil Shrestha (or Swop for short). I am a second year Computer Science and Mathematics major at [Luther College](https://cs.luther.edu) in Iowa. I have worked extensively with Python in the field of Data Engineering and Computer Science. I was previously a Data Engineering intern at [CloudFactory](https://www.cloudfactory.com/) and I aim to work with machine learning and artificial intelligence. If you have any questions or want to connect with me you can visit my [website](https://swopnilnep.github.io) or [email me](mailto:swopnil@pm.me).

## Preface

As the use of technology in all areas of life has been rapidly increasing, the demand and need for software engineering are becoming paramount. Software Engineering involves applying the ideas and principles of engineering to the software development field. Software engineers develop, test, debug design, maintain and evaluate that software that runs our world. With software running airplanes, medical devices, banks and online platforms like Google and Facebook, failure of software can have a massive impact on the economy and the world and can even lead to a loss of life. 

Software Engineer or Developer ranked **number one** in three of [US News' 2019 Job Rankings](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs).

If you are someone aiming to work in the domain of software engineering you will will need to the develop flexibility and the ability to adapt quickly to new innovations and ideas. Working in the fields of software engineering requires any software engineer to understand and apply the methods, workflows and tools to handled a fast paced and complex development cycles. In this website, I aim to review and apply concepts of objected oriented software engineering as well as choose and apply various data structures and algorithms in problems. I will also write about UML modeling, common patterns and project management techniques that are used in complex software development environments.

## Learning Goals

* Review and apply object oriented programming techniques in programs
* Understand agile methods and prototyping
* Understanding basic practices in SCM (Software Configuration Management)
* Learn Unified Modeling Language
* Understand the different phases of a software engineering project and common patterns
* Learn common techniques and practices in project management and organization

## Content

The goal of this website is to provide a concise introduction or review of the main practices used in software engineering. This website offers valuable information about the development of complex software systems and it is expected that you are familiar with at least one object oriented programming language like Python, Java or C++. 

This website is divided into 8 main topics which are divided into subsections. They are listed below along with hyperlinks to those topics.

3. Object Oriented Programming
1. Project Organization and Management
2. Software Configuration Management
4. Concepts of Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
5. System Design (Problem to Solutions and System Architecture)
6. Object Design
7. Model Based Testing and Quality Control
8. Build and Release Management

For each of the subsections, I will also add links to video lectures from the EdX's 'Software Engineering Essentials' [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:TUMx+SEECx+1T2018/course/) by TUMx and additional resources if you are interested in further reading about the topics.
