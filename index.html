<p><em>Note: This website will be in continuous development in the month of January 2019. There may be some incomplete or missing content in some parts of the project.</em></p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>As the use of technology in all areas of life has been rapidly increasing, the demand and need for software engineering are becoming paramount. Software Engineering involves applying the ideas and principles of engineering to the software development field. Software engineers develop, test, debug design, maintain and evaluate that software that runs our world. With software running airplanes, medical devices, banks and online platforms like Google and Facebook, failure of software can have a massive impact on the economy and the world and can even lead to a loss of life.</p>

<p>Software Engineer or Developer ranked <strong>number one</strong> in three of US News&rsquo; 2019 Job Rankings.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you are someone aiming to work in the domain of software engineering you will will need to the develop flexibility and the ability to adapt quickly to new innovations and ideas. Working in the fields of software engineering requires any software engineer to understand and apply the methods, workflows and tools to handled a fast paced and complex development cycles. In this website, I aim to review and apply concepts of objected oriented software engineering as well as choose and apply various data structures and algorithms in problems. I will also write about UML modeling, common patterns and project management techniques that are used in complex software development environments.</p>

<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Review and apply object oriented programming techniques in programs</li>
<li>Understand agile methods and prototyping</li>
<li>Understanding basic practices in SCM (Software Configuration Management)</li>
<li>Learn Unified Modeling Language</li>
<li>Understand the different phases of a software engineering project and common patterns</li>
<li>Learn common techniques and practices in project management and organization</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-software-engineering-process">The Software Engineering Process</h2>

<p>In this website, we cover in general the various frameworks and methodologies in the software engineering process also known as software development life cycle, software process or SDLC. These are a set of ideas and actions that are chosen case by case for taking a product from ideation (i.e. requirements) to its delivery and release as a final project. It is called a cycle because software development is A software engineering process is a set of related activities that leads to software production.</p>

<p>The step by step process for SDLC is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Project Planning and Feasibilty Study</li>
<li>Requirement Analysis</li>
<li>Design (Architecture)</li>
<li>Development of Coded (Implementation)</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Acceptance and Deployment</li>
<li>Maintainance and Support</li>
</ol>

<p>We will explore software engineering and the SDLC in further sections.</p>
